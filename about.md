I'm currently an assistant professor of Computer Science at
[Técnico Lisboa][IST] and a researcher at [INESC-ID].

I got my Ph.D. from [Técnico][IST] on July 2014 with a [dissertation][] titled
*Strongly Consistent Transactions for Enterprise Applications: Using Software
Transactional Memory to Improve Consistency and Performance of Read-Dominated
Workloads*.

I'm keen on using computer programming to solve everyday problems and I'm also
passionate about teaching.
