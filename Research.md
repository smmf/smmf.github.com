I got my Ph.D. from [TÃ©cnico][IST] on July 2014 with a [dissertation] titled
*Strongly Consistent Transactions for Enterprise Applications: Using Software
Transactional Memory to Improve Consistency and Performance of Read-Dominated
Workloads*. (Thesis presentation in PDF format [here][phd-presentation-pdf]).

I have participated in several Portuguese and European funded research
projects, and most of the [Software](/software/) I developed has been produced
in the context of these projects:

 * [ACE-GIS] (Adaptable and Composable E-commerce and Geographic Information
   Services)
 * [PASTRAMY] (Persistent and highly Available Software TRansactional MemorY)
 * [RuLAM] (Running Legacy Applications on Multicores)
 * [Cloud-TM] (Transactional, Object oriented, Self-tuning Cloud Platform)
